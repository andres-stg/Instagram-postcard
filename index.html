                <p>On February 25, 1964, 22-year-old Cassius Clay shocks the odds-makers by dethroning world heavyweight boxing champ
                    Sonny Liston in a seventh-round technical knockout. Liston was an 8-to-1 favorite. However, Clay predicted victory,
                    boasting that he would “float like a butterfly, sting like a bee” and knock out Liston in the eighth round. 
                    The fleet-footed and loquacious youngster who would later become known as Muhammed Ali needed less time to make good
                    on his claim—Liston, complaining of an injured shoulder, failed to answer the seventh-round bell. A few moments 
                    later, a new heavyweight champion was proclaimed. </p>
